            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Quindim is a delicious Brazilian dessert. My grandfather used to make this for me and my family.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded coconut</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
                <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>1 large egg white</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Mix sugar, coconut, and butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Add egg yolks and egg white; beat until well combined. Pour mixture into a 9-inch pie plate.</li>
                <li>Place the pie plate into a large roasting pan; pour enough boiling water into the bottom of the roasting pan to reach about halfway up the side of the pie plate.</li>
                <li>Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and bake until custard is golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately or refrigerate until serving.</li>
            </ol>
